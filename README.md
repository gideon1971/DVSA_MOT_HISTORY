This notebook is degined to extract MOT information for individual vehicles using the DVSA supplied API (Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency - DVSA)
The API supplies the same information that is found by using this web form https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk/

The MOT is an annual road worthiness type inspection for vehicles over 3 years old and passing is a legal requirement to drive on UK roads.

This information can point to obvious red flags when buying a used car.
