This notebook is degined to extract MOT information for individual vehicles using the DVSA supplied API (Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency - DVSA)
The API supplies the same information that is found by using this web form https://www.check-mot.service.gov.uk/

The MOT is an annual inspection for vehicles over 3 years old to deem them road worthy and passing is a legal requirement to drivwe on UK roads.
This is good information if you want to find obvious red flags when buying used cars.
